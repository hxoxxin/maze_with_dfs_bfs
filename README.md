# Mobile Programming with Java
This is the result of maze game app with DFS and BFS algorithm.


## Motivation
We developed this maze game app to apply graph theory concepts from our algorithm class and explore additional topics beyond the curriculum, specifically Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). 
This project allows us to deepen our understanding of these algorithms through hands-on implementation."

## Project Structure

For simplicity, We have implemented class diagrams with class names only. </br>
